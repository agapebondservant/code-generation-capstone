## Conventions

Throughout the book, concrete programming constructs or program output are presented  in  a  monospaced  font.  For  example,  when  abstractly  discussing server-side programs that use HTTP, I might refer to 'HTTP servlets' or just HttpServlet

'servlets,' but when I say I am talking about a specific Java class. User input is indicated in boldface, and command-line prompts are either generic  ( Prompt&gt; )  or  indicate  the  operating  system  to  which  they  apply ( DOS&gt; ). For instance, the following indicates that ' Some Output ' is the result when ' java SomeProgram ' is executed on any platform.

Prompt&gt; java SomeProgram Some Output

Important standard techniques are indicated by specially marked entries, as in the following example.

## Core Approach

Pay particular attention to items in 'Core Approach' sections. They indicate techniques that should always or almost always be used.

Notes and warnings are called out in a similar manner.
