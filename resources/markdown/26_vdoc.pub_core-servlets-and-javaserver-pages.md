## Introduction

- · Integrating servlets and JSP
- · Forwarding requests from servlets to static and dynamic resources
- · Using servlets to set up beans for use by JSP pages
- · An on-line travel agency combining servlets and JSP

## Part III: Supporting Technologies

Part III covers three topics that are commonly used in conjunction with servlets and JSP: HTML forms, applets talking to servlets, and JDBC. Topics include:

- · Sending data from forms
- · Text controls
- · Push buttons
- · Check boxes and radio buttons
- · Combo boxes and list boxes
- · File upload controls
- · Server-side image maps
- · Hidden fields
- · Grouping controls
- · Tab ordering
- · A Web server for debugging forms
- · Sending GET data from an applet and having the browser display the results
- · Having applets send GET data and process the results themselves (HTTP tunneling)
- · Using object serialization to exchange high-level data structures between applets and servlets
- · Having applets send POST data and process the results themselves
- · Applets bypassing the HTTP server altogether
