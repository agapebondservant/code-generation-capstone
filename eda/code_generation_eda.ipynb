    "### Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When observing the evaluation scores, we observe that they are mostly **left skewed**. This implies that **most of the population scores well on the most of the evaluation metrics**, which is the preferred behavior for a quality dataset. The only exception to the left skewedness are the **business requirements** metric scores.\n",
    "- For the following metrics, **30 or fewer** outliers out of a population of 346 did not score 1.0, implying that **92%** of the population scored a perfect score on these metrics:\n",
    "    - evaluations.relevancy.components.score\n",
    "    - evaluations.relevancy.summary.score\n",
    "    - evaluations.relevancy.keywords.score\n",
    "    - evaluations.relevancy.topics.score\n",
    "    - evaluations.relevancy.functional_requirements.score\n",
    "    - evaluations.coherence.summary.score\n",
    "    - evaulations.coherence.functional_requirements.score\n",
    "      \n",
    "- For all metrics except the business requirements, the **20th** percentile of scores was 0.8, which means **80%** of the population scored **0.8 or more** on at least 1 of the metrics. It does **not** mean that 80% of the population scored 0.8 or more on **all** of the metrics. For example, Code Snippet A might score 0.9 on Summary Relevancy but 0.1 on Business Requirements Relevancy, and Code Snippet B might score 0.9 on Business Requirements Relevancy but 0.1 on Summary Relevancy. In this case, both samples scored 0.8 on at least 1 metric, but neither score 0.8 on both.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The dataset tends to perform better with the **relevancy-based\" metrics than the **coherence-based\" metrics.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The metrics with the greatest spread were **Coherence metric for keywords**, **Coherence metric for business requirements** and **Relevancy metric for business requirements**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- We observe that\n",
    "    - 95% of the population scored 0.0 on at least 1 metric excluding business requirements\n",
    "    - 90% of the population scored 0.0 on at least 1 metric excluding business requirements\n",
    "    - 85% of the population scored 0.55 on at least 1 metric excluding business requirements\n",
    "    - 80% of the population scored 0.8 on at least 1 metric excluding business requirements\n",
    "      \n",
    "- From manual verification of the business requirements evaluation results:\n",
    "    - The business requirements actually appear to be valid despite their lower scores. For example, for the generated requirements \"1. The system must allow users to submit information via a web interface. 2. The system must provide immediate feedback to users after submission. 3. The system must ensure secure handling of user data. 4. The system must support concurrent user interactions without performance degradation. 5. The system must comply with applicable data protection regulations.\", the evaluator generated a below-optimal score of 0.4 with this explanation: \"The response provides a numbered list of business‑style requirements that are relevant to the servlet code and follows the requested format. However, it includes several functional requirements (e.g., submission handling, immediate feedback, concurrency support) that the instructions explicitly forbid, violating the rule to list only business requirements. This mismatch reduces the alignment score.\" In this case, the scorer has an overly strict definition of business vs technical requirements. Hence, it appears that the scorer has a **strict bias** and was **systematically underestimating** the scores.\n",
    "    - For similar reasons, the coherence metric for the domain model appears to be valid.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Based on the analysis above, we can:\n",
    "    - Repeat the above analysis, but exclude the **coherence** metrics in the quantile analysis.\n",
    "    - Add a new feature, **evaluation.min-score**, that captures the lowest score across all metrics for each sample. "
