    Here is a brief code summary:
    {inputs}
    
    Using the summary above, generate a language-agnostic Software Design Document (SDD). 
    The document should be structured, professional, and suitable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
    Also exclude any details that link the requirements to JSP, Java or any other specific programming language or framework.
    Instead, it should focus on universal concepts and architecture that can be implemented in any programming language.
    Stop after you have finished writing the 3 sections described below.
    
    The SDD must include the following sections:
    
    **1. System Architecture**
    *   **Overall Design:** Describe the main architectural patterns used and how the different components interact. 
    *   **Key Components:** Detail the primary modules, classes, domain model and services and their responsibilities.
    
    **2. Functional Requirements**
    *   **Input Handling:** How does the system accept inputs?
    *   **Data Processing:** Detail the main logic, algorithms, and data transformations.
    *   **Output Generation:** How are results produced and presented?
    
    **3. Business Requirements**
    *   **Business Rules:** Specific rules that govern how the business operates, which the software must enforce.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Measurable criteria to determine if the project is successful, also known as acceptance criteria.
    
    Only use the context provided in the summary above. Do not stray from the context provided in the summary. 
    Include named components and objects based on the context where it makes sense.
