    Here is a software specification:
    {spec}
    
    Using this specification, develop a complete NodeJS and React application based on the provided  document. The application should include both backend and frontend components with comprehensive unit testing using mock objects.
    Backend Requirements (NodeJS):
    
    1. Implement a RESTful API using Express.js or your preferred NodeJS framework. 
    2. Follow the services, data models, and business logic defined in the spec. Do NOT just develop a generic application.
    
    Frontend Requirements (React):
    
    1. Build responsive UI components in React.
    2. Develop the components according to the design specifications in the spec. Do NOT just develop a generic application.
    
    Unit Testing Requirements:
    
    Backend Tests:
    
    1. Write unit tests for all services, controllers, and utility functions.
    2. Use a mock testing framework like Jest (or Mocha/Chai) as the testing framework. Mock database calls, external API requests, and dependencies.
    3. Aim for high code coverage (70%+ minimum).
    
    
    Frontend Tests:
    
    1. Write unit tests for the React components.
    2. Use a mock testing framework like Jest and React Testing Library as the testing framework. 
    3. Aim for high code coverage (70+% minimum).
    
  expected_output: >
    A complete backend NodeJS implementation and frontend React application, with test suites and a README for setup instructions.
    All code should align with the requirements and technical specifications provided in the spec.

    Please extract the code and its file paths from the given context. 
    Write the extracted code to the specified file paths under the directory {code_base_path}.
    
    For example, given the following content:

    The index.js entrypoint
    ### app/index.js
    ```
    const express = require('express');
    ```

    The content 
    const express = require('express');
    would be extracted and written to the file path app/index.js.
    
  expected_output: >
    A complete codebase written at the specified file paths under {code_base_path}.
