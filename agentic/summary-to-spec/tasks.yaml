    Here is a brief code summary:
    {inputs}
    
    Using the summary above, generate a language-agnostic Software Design Document (SDD). 
    The document should be structured, professional, and suitable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
    Also exclude any details that link the requirements to JSP, Java or any other specific programming language or framework.
    Instead, it should focus on universal concepts and architecture that can be implemented in any programming language.
    
    The SDD must include the following sections:
    
    **1. System Architecture**
    *   **Overall Design:** Describe the main architectural patterns used and how the different components interact. 
    *   **Key Components:** List the primary modules, classes, domain model 
    and services and their responsibilities.
    
    **2. Functional Requirements**
    *   **Input Handling:** How does the system accept inputs?
    *   **Data Processing:** Detail the main logic used. Provide a 
    language-agnostic summary of the functions without getting into any of 
    the weeds of a specific programming language or framework.
    *   **Output Generation:** Explain how results are produced and presented.
    
    **3. Business Requirements**
    *   **Business Rules:** List the specific rules that govern how the 
    business operates, which the software must enforce.
    *   **Success Criteria:** List the measurable criteria to determine if the 
    project is successful, also known as acceptance criteria.
    
    Only use the context provided in the summary above. Do not stray from the context provided in the summary. 
    Include named components and objects based on the context where it makes sense.
    Make sure to exclude any details that link the requirements to JSP, Java or any other specific programming language or framework.
