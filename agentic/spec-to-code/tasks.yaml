    Here is a software specification:
    {spec}
    
    Using this specification, write the code for a complete NodeJS and React 
    application based on the provided  document. The code should include both 
    backend and frontend components with comprehensive unit testing using mock objects.
    Backend Requirements (NodeJS):
    
    1. Write the code for a RESTful API using Express.js or your preferred NodeJS framework. 
    2. Follow the services, data models, and business logic defined in the spec. Do NOT just develop a generic application.
    
    Frontend Requirements (React):
    
    1. Write the code for responsive UI components in React.
    2. Develop the components according to the design specifications in the spec. Do NOT just develop a generic application.
    
    Unit Testing Requirements:
    
    Backend Tests:
    
    1. Write unit tests for all services, controllers, and utility functions.
    2. Use a mock testing framework like Jest (or Mocha/Chai) as the testing framework. Mock database calls, external API requests, and dependencies.
    3. Aim for high code coverage (70%+ minimum).
    
    
    Frontend Tests:
    
    1. Write unit tests for the React components.
    2. Use a mock testing framework like Jest and React Testing Library as the testing framework. 
    3. Aim for high code coverage (70+% minimum).
    
    Code:
    
  expected_output: >
    The code for a complete backend NodeJS implementation and frontend React 
    application, with test suites and a README for setup instructions.
    All code should align with the requirements and technical specifications provided in the spec.
